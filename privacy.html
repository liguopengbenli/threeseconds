  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 09, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how ThreeSeconds ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information
    when you use the ThreeSeconds mobile application (the "App").
  </p>

  <h2>About the App</h2>
  <p>
    ThreeSeconds is a social skills training application designed to help users practice real-life conversations
    in everyday situations. The App provides guided conversation scenarios, feedback, and confidence-building
    exercises to improve communication, emotional awareness, and social presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    ThreeSeconds is <strong>not</strong> a dating service and does not facilitate real-world matches. It is a
    self-improvement tool focused on respectful, appropriate, and positive social interactions.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect or process the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic app usage data (analytics):</strong> such as screens viewed, feature usage, and general interaction events.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> such as device type, operating system version, app version, language, and crash logs.</li>
    <li><strong>AI conversation inputs (processed):</strong> messages you type may be processed to generate AI responses.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="box">
    <p style="margin:0;">
      <strong>Important:</strong> We do not ask you to create an account, and we do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data.
      Please avoid entering sensitive information (e.g., health details, government IDs, passwords) into the chat.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect or process to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the App’s core features.</li>
    <li>Generate AI conversation responses and interactive training scenarios.</li>
    <li>Improve performance, reliability, and user experience.</li>
    <li>Monitor usage, detect abuse, and help keep the App safe and respectful.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Where required by applicable law, we process personal data only when necessary to provide the service,
    comply with legal obligations, or based on our legitimate interests in operating, protecting, and improving the App.
  </p>

  <h2>AI Processing</h2>
  <p>
    The App includes AI-powered features. Your messages may be sent to and processed by third-party AI providers
    (for example, OpenAI) to generate responses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not need an account to use the App</strong>, and we do not design the App to store your conversation history on our servers.
    However, data may be processed transiently by service providers to generate responses and operate the service.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may use trusted third-party services to operate the App, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics providers</strong> (e.g., Firebase) to understand app usage and improve stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscription management</strong> (e.g., RevenueCat) to manage subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>AI service providers</strong> (e.g., OpenAI) to generate AI responses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Payments:</strong> subscription payments are processed by Apple/Google (and/or their payment processors).
    We do not collect or store your full payment card details.
  </p>

  <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Some third-party service providers may process data on servers located outside your country of residence.
    We take reasonable steps to ensure that data is handled securely and in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the service, operate the App, resolve issues,
    and comply with legal obligations. When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize data where reasonably possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for users aged <strong>18 and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

    data portability, and objection to processing.

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.
    However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
